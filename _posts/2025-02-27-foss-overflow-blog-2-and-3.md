## Catching Up After Midsems
Last week, I couldn't write a blog update due to my mid-semester exams. The exams took up most of my time, so I wasn‚Äôt able to work much on the project. However, now that they are over üí™, I am back to making progress on the CCPS Portal.

## Building the Discussion Forum
I have started working on the discussion forum feature, a key component of the CCPS Portal. This forum will enable users to engage in meaningful discussions, connect with alumni, and discuss job opportunities, internships, and career-related topics.

The forum will consist of a general discussion space open to all users, where broad conversations can take place. Additionally, there will be specific groups dedicated to various topics, such as internships, job openings, technical discussions, and alumni networking. These groups will be visible to all users, allowing them to explore and join discussions that align with their interests.

## Learning and Implementing Socket.io
To enhance real-time communication in the forum, I have been learning about **Socket.io**. It plays a crucial role in enabling real-time interactions, ensuring that users receive instant updates on discussions without requiring manual refreshes. I will apply Socket.io soon to facilitate real-time notifications for specific discussion threads.

## How Notifications Will Work ?
The discussion forums will be open to all users, allowing anyone to participate in conversations. However, notifications will be sent only to those who actively join a specific discussion, similar to how Telegram handles group notifications. This will keep users engaged without overwhelming them with unnecessary alerts.

Excited to implement these features and share more updates soon!
