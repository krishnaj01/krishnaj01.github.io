# Hi, I'm Krishna! ðŸª¶

I am currently pursuing my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **Indian Institute of Technology, Bhilai (IIT Bhilai)**. My journey into the world of technology and problem-solving began with a strong academic foundation, having successfully cleared **JEE Advanced 2023** with an impressive **All-India Rank (AIR) of 5688**. Additionally, I achieved a remarkable **98.84 percentile** in **JEE Mains 2023**, showcasing my proficiency in mathematics, physics, and chemistry.

My passion for **computer science** and **innovation** drives me to continuously explore new technologies, develop impactful projects, and contribute to the tech community.

This is a platform where I share insights, ideas, and experiences on coding, web development, UI/UX, and emerging technologies. Whether it's technical deep dives, industry trends, or practical development tips, I will aim to make complex concepts more accessible and engaging.
